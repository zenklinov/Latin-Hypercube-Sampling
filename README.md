# Latin-Hypercube-Sampling

This project is a simple implementation of the **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)** method using Python. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate how LHS can be used to efficiently estimate expected values from random distributions or stochastic processes by ensuring better coverage of the input space compared to traditional random sampling.

Use Cases: Engineering design simulations, uncertainty quantification.

## üöÄ Live Web App (Streamlit)

A live version of this project is available as a web app powered by **Streamlit**. Try it out here:
